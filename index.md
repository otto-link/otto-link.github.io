# Hi, I'm **Otto Link**

Welcome to my personal page! I build tools, C++ libraries, and procedural generation systems.

## Projects

### PointSampler - A C++ Library for Generating (and Labeling) Random 2D, 3D, or n-dimensional Points with Configurable Spatial Distributions

PointSampler is a lightweight C++ header-only library for generating and manipulating points in arbitrary dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, ... N-dimensional). It includes utilities for random sampling, jittered grids, importance sampling, density warping, spatial relaxation, and point clustering (labeling). The library is designed to be generic, extensible, and dimensionality-independent via std::array and C++ templates.
